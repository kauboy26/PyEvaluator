# PyEvaluator
Read the Evaulator readme for more info, I will update this later. For now, proposed features (I won't
be doing any more than what I'm proposing, this is an exhaustive list. If anything I will fall short
of these features) are:  

* Assignment statement processing
* Multi character variable names
* Pre-defined functions (you can call sin(x), etc)
* Finally (perhaps a little ambitious, I don't know how to accomplish this) defining and using your own functions.
