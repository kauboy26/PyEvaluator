# PyEvaluator
Read the Evaulator readme for more info, I will update this later. For now, proposed features (I won't
be doing any more than what I'm proposing, this is an exhaustive list. If anything I will fall short
of these features) are:  

* Assignment statement processing (done but untested)
* Multi character variable names (done but untested)
* Pre-defined functions (you can call sin(x), etc) (done but untested)
* Finally (perhaps a little ambitious, I don't know how to accomplish this) defining and using your own functions. (coming shortly)   

## Usage
You need Python 2.7 on your computer. Run the following:  
```
python lex_test_script.py
```  
That should start it and you will see a prompt ```>>```. Type in whatever expressions you want, like "```a0 = 1 + 3 * 4```", etc and have a blast.
